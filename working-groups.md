__Ethical Marketplace__ — Generate a curated list of toolkits, checklists and case studies across industries and domains. Develop a categorization system so that others may find a tool that they need for their project.

__Ethical Marketplace subgroups:__  Create volunteer committees of domain experts in the following: Civic Tech, Government Tech, Education/Academia, Private Industry, Social Scientists, and the Public.

__Literature Review__ - This working group will summarize new articles, blogs and other papers that are posted in our #ethics slack channel.

__Git and Github__ - Document, process, support and create structures for cataloguing the output of the ethical marketplace. Focus on transparency and accessibility process and all things, especially leveraging repos and public facing pages/sites.

__Welcome Committee__ -- develop onboarding process in slack and seek in-person events to welcome, recruit and support community-wide ethical practices and behaviors.

__Decolonizing Ethics__ - Examine, critique and integrate non-Western systems of ethical thinking. This group will support cultural and linguistical translation of our ethical principles, and create a series of blog posts that examine different topics such as privacy, bias from other lens.

__Ethical Structures__ in companies — Create, write and advocate for structures that support ethical decision making in industry (and other organizations). This could include an Ethical Data Compliance Officer, for instance. Collect signatures and build support at companies. Bedrock principles seep into these difference organizations.

__Research and Ethics__ — This working group will develop machine learning tools that assess and identify opportunities to include ethical thinking in algorithmic thinking  and seek partnerships with institutions bushing the boundaries of machine learning. Essentially, can we ask ourselves how to use algorithms to assess other algorithms for bias, fairness, inclusion?

__Ethical Imagination__ — This working group will think about the “what ifs” and create case studies that center upon the idea of speculative fiction, science fiction and ethical development that happens in conjunction with technological.
